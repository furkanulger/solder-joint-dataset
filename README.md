# Solder Joint Dataset
The dataset is obtained from passive SMDs and ICs' solder joints on PCBs. Solder errors are grouped as shifted, excessive, and insufficient solder, short circuit, and normal solder joints. The details of the dataset and the survey paper preprint is available at [[IEEE Xplore]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10129988)

| Class | Number |
| --- | --- |
| Normal | 2735 |
| Excessive | 92 |
| Insufficient | 149 |
| Shifted comp. | 114 |
| Short | 300 |
